# User Behavior Segmentation and Engagement Strategy

## Project Overview
This project aimed to analyze user behavior data for an app, segment users based on their behavior, and develop targeted engagement strategies for each user segment. The project utilized data analysis, clustering algorithms, and strategic planning to transform raw data into actionable insights.

## Methodology
The project followed a systematic approach, broken down into several key phases:

1. **Data Understanding and Preprocessing**
   - Loaded `userbehaviour.csv` and conducted preliminary analysis.
   - Cleaned and standardized the data for further analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Performed statistical analysis and visualized data distributions.
   - Identified key relationships and trends within the data.

3. **User Segmentation**
   - Applied the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment users.
   - Identified three distinct segments: Churn, Retained, and Needs Attention.

4. **Insight Generation and Reporting**
   - Characterized each segment based on average feature values.
   - Generated visualizations to illustrate the distribution of users and average feature values across segments.

## Key Findings
- The **Churn** segment showed moderate engagement and spending but was at risk of disengaging from the app.
- The **Retained** segment was highly engaged, consistently interacted with the app, and had high spending behavior.
- The **Needs Attention** segment had the lowest engagement and spending, indicating a potential area for focused re-engagement strategies.

## Actionable Plan
Developed a tailored action plan for each segment:

1. **Churn Segment**: Focus on re-engagement initiatives and gather feedback to understand and address potential dissatisfaction factors.
2. **Retained Segment**: Enhance user experience, encourage community building, and explore upsell/cross-sell opportunities.
3. **Needs Attention Segment**: Improve app usability, personalize re-engagement campaigns, and provide enhanced support to address this segment's unique challenges.

## Execution and Tracking
- Created an **Implementation Planning** document to outline the steps, timelines, and responsibilities for executing the action plans.
- Developed a **KPIs Tracking** file to monitor the effectiveness of the implemented actions and ensure alignment with the set objectives.

## Conclusion
This project exemplifies the power of data-driven strategies in understanding user behavior, segmenting users based on their interaction patterns, and developing targeted engagement plans to cater to the specific needs of each user segment. The actionable insights and strategic planning underscore the potential to drive user engagement and business growth through informed decision-making.
